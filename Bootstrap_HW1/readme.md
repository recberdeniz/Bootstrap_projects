# <strong>Printer Dunyasi Website Template With Bootstrap 5</strong>

Hello everyone, before this project, I created the same website and I used core html and css for that. Then I would upgrade front end with Bootstrap 5. <br><br>
I would like to share the screens of the all of my html scripts for this project.<br><br>
style.css file includes some hover, shadow styles and, text alignments. Other style formats were created by using Bootstrap 5 documentation. Thank you for your attention!
<br>
Here is my index html result:
